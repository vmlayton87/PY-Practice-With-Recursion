# Write code for algorithm 3 below:
# Write a function that returns the nth elements in the Fibonacci Sequence.

# The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers where the next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...
# For example, if n=4, then the result would be '2' and if n=2, the result would be '1'
# Here is more information on the Fibonacci Sequence: https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/fibonacci-sequence.html

# fibonacci seqence takes the two previous values and adds them together: f(0)=0, f(1)= F(0)+ 1, f(2)= f(1)+ f(0), f(n)=f(n-1)+f(n-2)
