# Write code for algorithm 5 below:
# Write a function that checks whether a string is a palindrome or not. The program should take in a string and return True if the string is a palindrome and False if not.

# A palindrome is a word that is the same when it is reversed, such as madam, radar, kayak, or tacocat.
